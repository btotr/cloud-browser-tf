          This document describes the concepts and architecture for the Cloud Browser. A conventional browser but the execution is shifted to the cloud. This has some architectural implication which this documents highlights.

          This is a public working on an architectural draft that the Cloud Browser Task Force is discussing and exploring. It has no official standing of any kind and does not represent the support or consensus of any standards organisation or contributor. This is a subset of the W3C Public Web & TV Interest Group - Cloud Browser Task Force. As the Cloud Browser TF progresses its work, this section will be used to identify the architecture that has reached rough consensus within the group.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          Today's browsers need a vast amount of hardware resources to process modern web sites or simply unable to support modern web technologies such as HTML5. The Cloud Browser concept addresses these issues by putting the browser into a more powerful, easier and manageable server or Cloud. The service execution is shifted to the Cloud, where the user interface is rendered and streamed down as a media stream to the client. The main functionality of the client is decoding and presenting the media stream to the end user. 
Using this design, it is possible to provide a uniform UI for a large range of devices. Furthermore, this concept reduces the need for processing power of the client and helps in deploying new browser technologies faster.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
          In a cloud browser architecture the execution is done on a server and the result is send down to a so-called runtime environment. This runtime environment is only responsible for displaying the stream and provide input information such-as key presses. In other words the runtime environment doesn't have any context of the running application nor it will interpreted input. An easy way to visualise the run time environment is to see it as a remote display which also act as gateway to send essential information to the cloud browser. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The cloud browser lives in an so-called orchestration which is mainly responsible for session management and abstraction. i.e. The cloud browser itself act as any other web browser but is executed on a server. The orchestration is the glue to make this happen. It is also responsible how the stream will send to the runtime environment as this is depending on the underlaying infrastructure. There are two main approaches, single stream and double stream.
      </p>  
      <h3>Single Stream<h3>  
      <p>
          The maximum number of functionalities that can be shifted into the Cloud environment is referred to as a single stream approach of a Cloud Browser

      <h3>Double Stream<h3>  
      <p>
          With regards to the double stream approach of a Cloud Browser, the Cloud Browser renders the UI only, while the media is delivered from another server. Thus, the UI and media streams are delivered separately to the client, which then has to combine both of these streams and present them to the end user in a unified form. This approach therefore enables reuse of the legacy video delivery infrastructures, e.g. multicast networks, cable networks, etc., thereby cutting down the unicast traffic that will be used only in certain cases where the UI stream is delivered.
