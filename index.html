          A Cloud Browser is a browser running and executing on a server. This document describes the concepts and architecture for the Cloud Browser. The main purpose is to provide the building blocks for a Cloud Browser solution.

          This is an Interest Group Note that the Cloud Browser Task Force of the Web and TV Interest Group is discussing and exploring. It has no official standing of any kind and does not represent the support or consensus of any standard organisations or contributors. This is a subset of the W3C Public Web &amp; TV Interest Group - Cloud Browser Task Force. As the Cloud Browser TF progresses its work, this section will be used to identify the architecture that has reached rough consensus within the group.
      </p>
      <p>
          The group have been working on various use cases of the Cloud Browser mechanism, and this "Cloud Browser Architecture Note" was originally a part of that discussion.  Note that the group have been working on the survey of exisiting similar mechanisms, and the group's basic plan is publishing the following three topics as three separate IG Notes first and then merge them into one consolidated Note later:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>Basic architecture (this "Cloud Browser Architcture" IG Note)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Cloud_Browser_TF/cloud_browser_vs_split_browser">Survey of the prior work (similarity/difference)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Cloud_Browser_TF/UseCases">Use cases and requirements</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
          It would take some more time to finalize the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Cloud_Browser_TF/cloud_browser_vs_split_browser">survey of the prior work</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Cloud_Browser_TF/UseCases">Use cases and requirements</a>.
      However, the group would like to start to get wider review and comments from the public for the basic architectural mechanism first.

    <section class="introductory">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
         The web becomes a feature rich platform. Media capturing, web workers, and many other features ensure an engaging web experience. The increase of features impacts the hardware resources. Provide the same experience to a variety of devices is difficult; therefore, the industry is shifting to another model. Leading content providers will not use a general web browser anymore; instead, a customised web browser is used. Some only use a subset of the web specifications. Some create their own proprietary language. Others will implement a native javascript framework. This assures (near) the same experience on each device and doesn't have to bother with the device varieties. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Several web browsers, on a single device, is not desirable. It causes fragmentation and uses client device resources; not a durable solution. The Cloud Browser addresses these issues by putting the browser into a powerful server, or cloud. The execution is shifted to the cloud, where the user interface is rendered and send to the Client Device. The main purpose of the client device is presenting the user interface to the end user. This solution makes it possible to provide a uniform experience for a large range of devices. Furthermore, it reduces the need for processing on the client device and helps to deploy new browser technologies faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great number of users are experiencing the Cloud Browser technology today. The concept of a Cloud Browser is never defined as standardised work; differences with traditional client server model are not explored. This group note is a joined effort from the Cloud Browser Task Force. It provides requirements, use cases and a formalised architecture of a Cloud Browser.
      <p>
      <h3>Cloud Browser compared to a local browser</h3>
      <p>
        Most people are familiar with local browsers. A content server serves resources such as HTML, Javascript, and media. The local browser requests the resources and makes it perceivable for the end-user. The local browser exists in the operating system. Starting and stopping the browser is the responsibility of the operating system. In addition, it provides hardware functionality such as keyboard inputs. A Cloud Browser differ in varies aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An operating system or desktop environment is not interacting with the web browser.</li>
        <li>Execution is done on the server but the user interface is displayed on a client device.</li>
        <li>The client device isn't constraint by resources such as memory or CPU.</li>
        <li>The Cloud Browser isn't directly connected to the Client Device hardware.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cloud Browser compared with a split browser</h3>
      <p>
        A split browser, or transformation proxy, transform the content to the most appropriate format for the client device. The Cloud Browser is comparable but different. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Split browsers provide the best possible representation but are limited by the client capabilities. The split browser could optimise the content but the client needs to process the content. A Cloud Browser terminates everything on the server; therefore, circumvent this problem.</li>
        <li>The Cloud Browser exists in the cloud. The initiator or client device is only triggering events but is not responsible for the resources nor the representation.</li>
        <li>A Split browser "transforms" the content. The Cloud Browser acts as a local browser; therefore, don't alter the content.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cloud Browser compared with a thin/fat paradigm</h3>
      <p>
        In a thin/fat paradigm, all processing is done on the server and the user interface is provided to a thin- or zero-client. The Cloud Browser is very comparable but has three key differences: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a thin/fat paradigm, there are dependencies on an underlying operating system. The Cloud Browser only provides the web browser without dependencies.</li>
        <li>The Cloud Browser may complement web features, virtually.</li>
        <li>The Cloud Browser leverage client capabilities where applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
          The Cloud Browser Architecture is provided in the following section. The goal is to have a consistent architecture between Cloud Browser vendors.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Client Device</h4>
        <p>
            A Client Device is a apparatus where the user interface is presented. The Client Device needs to be connected.  A Client Device could be A Set-Top-Box. A Client Device could be a mobile phone. A Client Device could even be a smart watch. Provided that a Cloud Browser Client is available. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Cloud Browser Client</h4>
        <p>
            In a Cloud Browser solution, the execution is done in the cloud; the result is sent to the Cloud Browser Client. This Cloud Browser Client is only responsible for showing the user interface and providing essential information such as key strokes. The latter is depending on the infrastructure. It will be transport and format agnostic. In other words, it will be vendor specific or may be standardised in the future. The Cloud Browser Client doesn't have any context. It connects to the orchestration and shows the user interface. This will make sure that all the logic is in the cloud, and avoid, otherwise required updates, on the Client Device. A way to visualise the Cloud Browser Client is a remote display which sends essential information to the Cloud Browser Orchestration.
        </p>
      </section>  
      <section>
        <h4>Cloud Browser</h4>
        <p>
         The Cloud Browser denoted in the architecture is a web browser instance, terminated in the orchestration. It acts as a local web browser. Consequently, existing Web Application doesn't have to be authored for a Cloud Browser Solution.
        </p>
      </section>  
      <section>
        <h4>Orchestration</h4>
        <p>
          The Cloud Browser exists in an orchestration that is responsible for session management and abstraction. Multiple Cloud Browsers Clients could connect to the orchestration. The orchestration makes sure a client connects to the right Cloud Browser instance. Furthermore, any difference with a local browser is abstracted. For example, a Client Device may have constraints on codec capabilities. By abstracting those constraints the orchestration could either provide this to a W3C standardized API or virtually enhance this constraint by transcoding to a supported codec. Either way, the Cloud Browser is unaware of the decisions. This typical example ensures that the Client Device could run any Web Application, regardless of the codec it mandates. In which manner the orchestration is abstracted is out of scope for this document, and up to the implementor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The orchestration receives triggers from the Cloud Browser Client such as key strokes originated from the remote control. Triggers are not restricted to input. It could be any information from the Client Device. The orchestration interpreted the triggers and may decide to delegate it to the Cloud Browser. Depending on the context a red button could be process as a regular key press by the Cloud browser or opens a new Web Application on a certain URL. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The orchestration decides how the user interface is sent to the Cloud Browser Client. There are two main approaches, a Single Stream and a Double Stream approach. The stream format is agnostic to the architecture because this encourages innovation.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>      
    
    <section>
      <h5 id="single-stream">Single Stream</h5>  
      <p>
          In the Single Stream approach, the orchestration provides both, the user interface and the media streams.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/images/0/0c/Ss-cp-highlevel.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Architecture single stream</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This approach executes the Web Application in the Cloud Browser and delivers the user interface to the Cloud Browser Client. A typical use case: the user starts the Client Device. The Cloud Browser Client triggers a signal. The signal is received and resolved in the orchestration. It delegates further processing to the Cloud Browser. The Cloud Browser request, download, and parse the resources. These resources include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is processed and executed. User Interface painting commands are sent to the Graphic Library.
      <p>
      </p>
        In case the Web Application requests a media stream from a Media Server. The Graphic Library will combine the media stream together with the User Interface. The Orchestration sent a single media stream to the Cloud Browser Client; encoded by a Client Device supported codec. The Cloud Browser Client decode and present the stream to the Client Device display.
      </p>
    </section>
 
    <section>  
      <h5 id="double-stream">Double Stream</h5>  
      <p>
          With a Double Stream approach, the Cloud Browser renders the user interface only, while the media is delivered from another source. The User Interface and media streams are delivered separately to the Client Device, which then has to combine both of these streams. The Cloud Browser Client present them to the end-user in a unified form. This approach leverages the video delivery infrastructures. A typical example of a delivery infrastructure is broadcast networks. Here the media is sent to all receivers at ones. Rerouting the traffic is not desired.</p>

      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        This approach executes the Web Application and delivers the User Interface to the Cloud Browser Client as the single stream approach. A media stream is delivered Out Of Band from another source. Blending is done on the Cloud Browser Client. The user interface is usually provided as a sequence of images which a Client Device could process within its own Graphic Library.</p>
